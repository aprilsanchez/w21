# Teaching Resources
{: .no_toc .mb-2 }

Throughout this course, we will be using various resources and references.

Below are some of the teaching tips that we outlined during our initial lectures.

### Don't
* Don't take control of the student's keyboard (without asking).
  - Doesn't apply as much in time of Covid (over Zoom), but even so.
* Don't give away the answer (unless a student is really stuck / is extremely frustrated, the answer is very trivial).
* Don't be condescending.
* Don't be afraid to say "I don't know but let's find out".
* Don't undermine the course, the lab, the instructor, your peers.
* Don't use terms that students don't know
  - Or if you do, "remind them" what the term means.


### Do
* Keep your cool even if the student is anxious or belligerent.
* Keep the interaction interesting.
* Refer to the lab/homework write up and syllabus where appropriate.
* If you don't know how to handle a situation, inform the TA or instructor.
* Reflect on your tutoring/TA sessions to thoghtfully and deliberately improve.


### Key Take-aways (Peer Mentoring Activity)
* Gauging how a student is feeling may be important; you may need to adjust your demeanor/tone with the student accordingly to make them more comfortable or to diffuse stress.
* It's important not to trivialize students'  problems.
* Ask clarifying questions at the beginning, before trying to tackle a problem head-on.
* Ask students to explain what they've already tried.
* Let students describe what their code is doing / what the problem is; don't try to just look at the code first and figure it out on your own.
* Lead the student towards the issue rather than telling them where the issue is in their code.
* Encourage students to experiment with their code themselves rather than giving them direct answers.
* Refrain from telling students whether their code is right and have them walk through an example or run their code themselves after making modifications.
