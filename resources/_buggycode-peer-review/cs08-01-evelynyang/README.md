# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 08

## Contributed by Evelyn Yang

### Programming question

buggy.py: (from a quiz) The student is unsure why this code is considered incorrect/does not run. "Is it wrong because I'm printing from main rather than from the function?"

### Conceptual questions

"What does it mean by function call?"
