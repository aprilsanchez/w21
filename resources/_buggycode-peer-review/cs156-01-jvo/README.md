# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 156

## Contributed by Justin Vo

### Programming question

- Why am I receiving a compilation error?
- Why does the compilation error say "value may be uninitialized"?

### Conceptual questions

- How do you initialize an Array object?
- How do you initialize an Array with size?
- How do you initialize an Array with initial values easier?
- Why can't I initialize an Array in the stack in Java?
- How do you read a stacktrace?
