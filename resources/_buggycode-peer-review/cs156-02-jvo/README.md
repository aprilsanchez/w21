# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 156

## Contributed by Justin Vo

### Programming question

- Why isn't the name being correctly set for my Duck?
- Why is the same name being printed the second time even though I changed it?

### Conceptual questions

- What does `this` mean?
- Why can't I have a reference variable to the duck's name like in C++?
