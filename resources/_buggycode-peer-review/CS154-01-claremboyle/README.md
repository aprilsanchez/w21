### Conceptual question

Homework Question: Consider the binary number âˆ’1.11001100 (where the last 4 bits keep repeating). Given a half precision floating point format: Calculate what decimal number this is and figure out what (rounded-up) decimal
number that this is approximating.

Student Questions: 
* What does it mean by "figure out what (rounded-up) decimal number that this is approximating"?
* Do you want us to round up to the next number representable in half-precision? Based on my calculations, rounding down would be closer.
* I just computed the exact value in decimal of the repeating binary expansion and got a terminating decimal. Is this enough?
* I computed the decimal mathematically so it is exact. What's the other number I need to find?
* The number I computed cannot be represented by a floating point binary representation. What's the other one?
