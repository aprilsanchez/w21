# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 156

## Contributed by Justin Vo

### Programming question

- Why am I receiving a compilation error?
- Why does the compilation error say "unreachable catch block"?

### Conceptual questions

- How is the second catch block unreachable?
- How does catching different exceptions work then?
- What does `extends` mean?
- How does inheritance work?
