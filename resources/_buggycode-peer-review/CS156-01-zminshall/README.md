# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 156

## Contributed by Zachary Minshall

### Programming question
buggy.js: This is the code I have in my Rational.js.
We have to modify the Rational class so that all of the tests pass. I have one test that still isn't passing and I don't know why
because the function that is being tested passes for its other tests! I have included a screenshot of the failing test and the relevent code
in the rational class.

### Conceptual questions
What is the difference between running 'npm test' and 'mvn test'?

How can we test our test code so that we are sure it is a good measurement of code quality?
