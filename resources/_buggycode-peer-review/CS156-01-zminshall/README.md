# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 156

## Contributed by Zachary Minshall

### Programming question
buggy.js: This is the code I have in my Rational.js
FailingTest.PNG: This is the output of my failing test
subtract.Test.jsx: This is the test code for the Subtract function

We have to modify the Rational class so that all of the tests pass. My "subtract" function still isn't passing and I don't know why! The tests for my "minus" function pass and the "subtract" function is just utilizing the "minus"! I have included a screenshot of the failing test (FailingTest.PNG), the test code (subtract.Test.jsx), and the relevant code in my Rational class (buggy.js).

### Conceptual questions
What is the difference between running 'npm test' and 'mvn test'?

How can we test our test code so that we are sure it is a good measurement of code quality?
