# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 156

## Contributed by Justin Vo

### Programming question

- Why is this code not working? It is not reversing and in fact it's deleting the rest of the list!
- Why does my reverseLL function not work even though I have the correct logic?

### Conceptual questions

- When should I use a `for` loop and when should I use `while` loop?
- How does creating a copy of an object work?
