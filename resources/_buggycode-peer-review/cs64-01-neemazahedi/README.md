### Programming question:
Why is it that my function output is right, but when my function output returns, the other functions in the lab have inccorect values?

### Conceptual questions:
What is the point of MIPS calling convention?   
What should I be saving in the stack?  
Why is it that I have to do offsets of 4 in MIPS?
