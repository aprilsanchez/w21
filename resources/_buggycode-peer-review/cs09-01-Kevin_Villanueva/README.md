# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 09

## Contributed by Kevin Villanueva

### Programming question

(in the file studentBuggyCode)
buggy.py: When running the test file, we end up getting the following error: "AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'rent'"

### Conceptual questions

My code passes all the test cases on grade scope, but not locally. How is this possible?
