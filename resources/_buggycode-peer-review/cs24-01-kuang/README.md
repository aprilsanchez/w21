# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 24

## Contributed by Paul Kuang

### Programming question

buggy.cpp: This is the code I have to implement in my linkedlist lab, I need to insert the value in a sorted linked list. However, I don't understand the recurive way of implement this, and I feel kind of lost. I feel like I understand the logic behind it, but it didn't seem to work.

### Conceptual questions

How to test the code?
What is a recursive function?
How to iterate linkedlist?
