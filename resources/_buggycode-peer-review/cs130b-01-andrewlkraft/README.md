# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 130b

## Contributed by Andrew Kraft

### Programming question

 > main.cpp: "The code works for the first two times it outputs the contents of q, however the third time it doesn't print anything."

### Conceptual questions

* Which functions could be buggy to cause this issue?
* What sort of things cause undefined behavior in your code?
* How can you make sure you aren't doing things which could cause undefined behavior?
