# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 156

## Contributed by Jayleen Li

### Programming question
buggy.java: This is the code I have in my Menu.java.
We have to sort through different MenuItems (another class) within the Menu class using Comparators that the professor talked about in class. However, I don't understanding the proper syntax for .comparing, and my code isn't compiling although I feel like I am following the syntax correctly?

Followup: Why are the compound ones also failing?

### Conceptual questions
Why is code testing important?

What's the difference between maven/spring boot and React?
