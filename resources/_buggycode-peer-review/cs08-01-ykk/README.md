# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 08

## Contributed by Prof. K

### Instructions for this assignment

Write a program that takes an integer input corresponding to a total change amount and outputs the change using the fewest coins, one coin type per line. The coin types are dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Use singular and plural coin names as appropriate, like 1 penny vs. 2 pennies.
...

Your program must define and call the following function. The function `exact_change()` should return `num_dollars, num_quarters, num_dimes, num_nickels, and num_pennies`.
`def exact_change(user_total)`

### Programming question

Why is it that when I call my function with 141 as input, I get 0 nickels instead of 1 nickel?

### Conceptual questions

How do I go about debugging this code.
