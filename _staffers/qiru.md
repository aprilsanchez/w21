Hello! Iâ€™m Qiru, a 2nd year B.S student in Computer Science. I've just started tutoring in the CS Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULA) program in Winter 2021. The Course I'm tutoring for is CS32. I love video games and fictions. I spend a lot of time on YouTube and Bilibili, watching cat videos. Feel free to come to my office hours if you have any question or something to share with me. I'm glad to chat with you.
