Hey hey hey! I'm a third year Computer Science student, and I love helping other people out! If I'm not busy working on a CS project, you can find me playing Smash Ultimate, watching anime, or listening to k-pop. It's my first time tutoring a course, so I'm looking forward to learning about how this whole process goes!
I'm currently trying to learn HTML/CSS, and it's been a wild ride so far. I'm hopeful that I'll be able to do my job well as a ULA, and I'm always down to talk. Stay groovy y'all :)
