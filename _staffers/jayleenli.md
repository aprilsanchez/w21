Hello! My name is Jayleen and I am a 4th year undergrad Computer Science Major. I am a ULA for CS156 and this is my first time tutoring ever so I'm really excited! I'm interested in distributed systems, cloud and backend infrastructure. At the moment, I am trying to learn more about augmented, mixed, and virtual reality. Outside of CS, my interests include 3d art, 3d printing, kpop and video games. Feel free to come to my office hours to chat about anything!
