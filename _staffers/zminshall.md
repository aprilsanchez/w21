Hello! I'm Zachary Minshall, a recent transfer student, and a third year in the B.S. Computer Science program.
Currently I am interested in solving algorithm programming problems, artificial intelligence, and cyber security.
Outside of CS, my interests include mountaineering, smash ultimate, strength training, meditation, and camping. As
an LA I hope to contribute to developing and maintaining growth-minded culture here at UCSB.
