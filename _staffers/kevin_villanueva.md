Hey! I'm Kevin Villanueva and I'm one of the Undergraduate Learning Assistants for CS09. I've been programming since highschool and will probably continue to do so until I find something better to do. My hobbies include working out, tai chi and meditating. Fun fact: I got covid while I was studying abroad in Spain May 2020.
