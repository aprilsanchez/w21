Hello everyone my name is Ellen Burrell and I am a sophomore Political Science Major. Iâ€™m hoping to double major in Data Science and use data analysis to shape public policy. I am currently a Research assistant for the Environmental and Energy Transitions (ENVENT) Lab here at UCSB. I research environmental violence in Indonesia and Peru. In my free time I enjoy being outside, riding my bike, backpacking, and cooking with my friends.
